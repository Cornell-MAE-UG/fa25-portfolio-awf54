Hi! My name is Anna and I am a junior studying mechanical engineering at
Cornell University. I am interested in how engineering can be used to improve
lives and connect communities, and have explored this through my participation
in the Engineers in Action project team at Cornell. Over the past two years, I’ve
participated in the design and construction of two pedestrian footbridges in
Eswatini. In both of these projects, I spent two months living with a local
homestead family and working with the community every day, learning from them
and growing with them. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, and learning new instruments.
