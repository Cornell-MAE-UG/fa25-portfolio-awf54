For a class, we were asked to analyze a basic torque wrench design using the finite element analysis software, ANSYS. We then created our own torque wrench design by choosing an appropriate material, creating a MATLAB script to do basic design calculations, CADing our design, and finally analyzing our design in ANSYS. We were given a set of criteria to meet, such as factors of safety and an applied torque. The following document summarizes work analyzing both the initial given design as well as my own design. My design begins on page 6 of the pdf. This project was done in collaboration with Emily Felts.
