For my system dynamics class, I worked with a group to dissect a hand mixer and write a report on its mechanisms and system dynamics. We found that the hand mixer utilized and open-loop system and through the use of a high-speed camera, found that the settling times of the whisk at different settings was impressively fast. The full report on the system is as follows.
